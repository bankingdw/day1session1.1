1. Various sources of Big Data
• This flood of data is coming from many sources 
• The New York Stock Exchange generates about 4-5 terabytes of data everyday • Facebook hosts more than 240 billion photos,
growing at 7 petabytes of data everyday
• Ancestory.com, the genealogy site stores
around 10 petabytes of the data
• The Internet Archive stores around 18.5
petabytes of data
• The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva
produces about 30 Petabytes of data every year

2. 3 V's of Big data
variety-diffrent varieties of data
volume-large data size
velocity-speed of access by user

3.
Vertical Scaling
• Increase the configuration of a single system
• Like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer speed
• Complex, costly, and time consuming process
Horizontal scaling
• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
storage/processing among them
• Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
• Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM,
use 40 machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM


4. Need and Working of Hadoop
storing and processig large amount of data.
parallel processing. inexpensive and fast access.
hadoop uses mapreduce.it uses name node and data nodes as master slave.
